Welcome to the Trackmatic API documentation. Whether you're building custom workflows for your support team, integrating Trackmatic into your product, or managing users across installations, our APIs provide the flexibility and power to help you do more with Trackmatic.

Trackmatic provides three categories of APIs, each designed with a specific use case in mind:

- **Application APIs** – For account-level automation and agent-facing integrations.
- **Client APIs** – For building custom chat interfaces for end-users
- **Platform APIs** – For managing and administering installations at scale

---

## Application APIs

Application APIs are designed for interacting with a Trackmatic account from an agent/admin perspective. Use them to build internal tools, automate workflows, or perform bulk operations like data import/export.

- **Authentication**: Requires a user `access_token`, which can be generated from **Profile Settings** after logging into your Trackmatic account.
- **Availability**: Supported on both **Cloud** and **Self-hosted** Trackmatic installations.

---

## Client APIs

Client APIs are intended for building custom messaging experiences over Trackmatic. If you're not using the native website widget or want to embed chat in your mobile app, these APIs are the way to go.

- **Authentication**: Uses `inbox_identifier` (from **Settings → Configuration** in API inboxes) and `contact_identifier` (returned when creating a contact).
- **Availability**: Supported on both **Cloud** and **Self-hosted** Trackmatic installations.

---

## Platform APIs

Platform APIs are used to manage Trackmatic installations at the admin level. These APIs allow you to control users, roles, and accounts, or sync data from external authentication systems.

> **Note:** Platform APIs cannot access accounts or users created via the Trackmatic UI, or by other API keys. They can only access accounts, users, and other objects created by the specific platform API key used for authentication, or objects explicitly permitted to that API key.

- **Authentication**: Requires an `access_token` generated by a **Platform App**, which can be created in the **Super Admin Console**.
- **Availability**: Available on **Self-hosted** / **Managed Hosting** Trackmatic installations only.

Use the right API for your use case, and you'll be able to extend, customize, and integrate Trackmatic into your stack with ease.

## FAQ

### Why do I get a 401 'Non permissible resource' error when using Platform API tokens?

Platform APIs cannot access accounts or users created via the Trackmatic UI, or by other API keys. They can only access accounts, users, and other objects created by the same API key, or objects explicitly permitted to that API key. If you need to grant a Platform App access to an object (such as an Account) that it did not create, please contact your system administrator.

### What should I do if the API documentation appears outdated?

If you encounter discrepancies between the API documentation and actual API behavior, we recommend inspecting the actual requests made by the Trackmatic UI through your browser's developer console Network tab to see the exact request format and payload structure that works with the current API, then replicate the same request structure in your integration.
