## Trackmatic Developer Documentation

This is the official repository for the Trackmatic developer documentation. This guide contains everything you need to know about Trackmatic APIs and build custom flows on top of Trackmatic APIs.

### 👩‍💻 Development

npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is)

```
mint dev
```

### 😎 Publishing Changes

Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

You can also preview changes using PRs, which generates a preview link of the docs.
